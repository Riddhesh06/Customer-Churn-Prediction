# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Goal : Predict which customers are likely to churn (i.e., stop using a companyâ€™s service).

Why it matters: Retaining existing customers is much cheaper than acquiring new ones. If you can flag "at-risk" customers, the business can target them with offers, discounts, or improved service.

Business Outcome:

Reduce churn rate by X%.

Prioritize customers for retention campaigns.

Estimate potential savings from reduced churn.

ðŸ“Š Example Project Workflow

Load dataset (Telco Customer Churn).

EDA â†’ find churn distribution & insights.

Preprocess â†’ encode categories, handle imbalance.

Train logistic regression â†’ interpret coefficients.

Train random forest â†’ tune hyperparameters.

Evaluate â†’ achieve X% ROC-AUC.

Extract insights â†’ high charges + month-to-month drive churn.
